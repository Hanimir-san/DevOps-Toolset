# DevOps Toolset

A collection of tools developed while learning about DevOps concepts and in personal projects. Feel free to use any of them wherever you need. Also - as a reminder to myself - all changes to this repo are to be made with command line tools. This includes creating the remote repository. That's why the main branch is called master. GitHub took away our inuendos but Linus made sure they are preserved. 

Also use vim. I am not asking.
